# SET UP


1. Install Ionic Lab ( http://lab.ionic.io/ );
2. Clone SeleccoesAEFEUP's repository ( https://github.com/pedro-c/SelecoesAEFEUP );

3. Open Ionic lab;
4. Go to File, Open Existing App, Select SeleccoesAEFEUP git folder;
5. Click on the app on the left and then click 'start server'.
6. Now you have your app emulated both on iphone and android. This is where you'll test your app and see any changes you made. Simple :)

7. OPTIONAL. I'm using Atom for development.
8. Right click on the left side of the IDE and click add Project Folder, select SeleccoesAEFEUP git folder.
9. Now you can go ahead and edit your app on atom and see the applied changes on Ionic Lab.

10. BIRA!

P.S. You may have to install some dependencies such as node.js and cordova framework, I already had them installed so I'm not sure which ones you have to install but any doubt just ask :)

Everything about building with Ionic can be found here - http://ionicframework.com/docs/overview/

# To Figure Out

1. How to get the scores into the app;
2. Where to save them (firebase?);


# Development Plan

1. Design the overall look of the app (maybe test it on a real android/iphone);
2. API for the scores;
3.
